        <p>I am currently pursuing my <em>Bachelorâ€™s in Technology in Computer 
            Science and Engineering at VIT Vellore</em>. My academic foundation 
            has been complemented by hands-on experience through participation in 
            several hackathons. Notably, I had the privilege of competing in DevJams 24 
            organized by <em>Google Developer Students Club</em>, where my team 
            worked on integrating learning and collaboration among students. This 
            experience taught me the value of teamwork, creative problem-solving, and 
            working under tight deadlines. Hackathons have always been a fantastic 
            opportunity for me to learn, network, and put my knowledge to the test 
            in dynamic, real-world scenarios. Each event has inspired me to keep 
            honing my technical and collaborative skills.</p>

            initiatives that use technology to solve pressing problems and improve 
            lives. I thrive in <strong>collaborative environments</strong> where 
            diverse ideas come together to create meaningful solutions. With a focus 
            on innovation and teamwork, I aim to make a positive impact in the tech 
            world, whether through groundbreaking projects, developing applications, 
            or mentoring and learning from others in the field.</p>
            </div>
