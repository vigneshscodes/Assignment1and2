        <p>I am currently pursuing my <em>Bachelorâ€™s in Technology in Computer 
            Science and Engineering at VIT Vellore</em>. My academic foundation 
            has been complemented by hands-on experience through participation in 
            several hackathons. Notably, I had the privilege of competing in DevJams 24 
            organized by <em>Google Developer Students Club</em>, where my team 
            worked on integrating learning and collaboration among students. This 
            experience taught me the value of teamwork, creative problem-solving, and 
            working under tight deadlines. Hackathons have always been a fantastic 
            opportunity for me to learn, network, and put my knowledge to the test 
            in dynamic, real-world scenarios. Each event has inspired me to keep 
            honing my technical and collaborative skills.</p>

        <p>Looking forward, my ultimate goal is to contribute to impactful projects 
            that leave a lasting mark. I am particularly excited about working on 
            initiatives that use technology to solve pressing problems and improve 
            lives. I thrive in <strong>collaborative environments</strong> where 
            diverse ideas come together to create meaningful solutions. With a focus 
            on innovation and teamwork, I aim to make a positive impact in the tech 
            world, whether through groundbreaking projects, developing applications, 
            or mentoring and learning from others in the field.</p>

        <p><span title="this is span tag">As an enthusiastic learner and problem solver</span>, I am deeply passionate 
            about <b>programming and technology</b>. Over the past two years, I have 
            actively worked on enhancing my skills through a variety of academic 
            projects and extracurricular endeavors. My journey has been fueled 
            by an innate curiosity to explore, create, and refine innovative 
            solutions to real-world problems. I enjoy tackling challenges head-on, 
            whether it involves debugging complex code or brainstorming ideas for 
            impactful tech projects. My dedication to learning has led me to 
            continuously push my boundaries and embrace opportunities for growth.</p>
